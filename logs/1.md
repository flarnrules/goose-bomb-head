This is the log for silly little goosebomb head

just created the google business.

need to obtain domain names

need to make sure cofiguration is good

neeed to make it look good

need to figure out how to sell a shirt or whatever

can probably use this to do nfts first

yes that was the plan

nfts create seed capital to create apparel business

you get a portion of your design!!!

== okay yes here we go

so we can use the splitter contract.

the first collection, each piece is linked to a design on the online apparel website

if the design you own ever generates a sale, you would receive a portion of that sale because you literally own the design

the designs are randomly generated combinations of shirts, pants, hats, images that all can be used to order merch.

Kind of like pseudo custom merchandise?
